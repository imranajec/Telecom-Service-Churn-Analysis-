# Telecom-Service-Churn-Analysis-Project
Conducted data analysis on a synthetic telecom service provider data set of over 7000 customers, using techniques such as feature engineering, data normalization, and data imputation.
Developed a random forest model to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 94%, using machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and random forests. 
Deployed the model using Flask to help the telecom service provider identify and prevent customer churn.
